Problem Statement
Extracting useful information from a dataset about a particular property, guest name, room type etc, can be a tedious task. There is a lot of scattered data present in he dataset and finding meaningful information out of it can be a very painful and challenging job, requiring more time and effort. Visually appealing charts will give an aesthetic look and feel to the audience hence giving a meaningful insight.
